# Render Free Tier Limitations

## Current Issues

The backend server is deployed on Render's free tier, which has the following limitations:

### 1. **Request Timeout**
- **Free tier timeout:** 30 seconds
- **Cold start delays:** Server may take 10-30 seconds to wake up
- **MT5 timeout:** 3-5 seconds (too short for Render free tier)

### 2. **HTTP 502 Errors**
- **Cause:** Server not ready or timed out
- **Frequency:** Common on free tier
- **Impact:** EA falls back to default parameters

### 3. **Performance Issues**
- **Cold starts:** Server sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity
- **Limited resources:** 512MB RAM, shared CPU
- **Network latency:** Additional delays

## Solutions

### Option 1: Upgrade to Render Paid Tier
- **Cost:** ~$7/month
- **Benefits:** No cold starts, faster responses, 99.9% uptime
- **Recommended:** For production trading

### Option 2: Use Local Backend Server
- **Setup:** Run backend on your local machine
- **Benefits:** No timeouts, instant responses, full control
- **Requirements:** Python 3.8+, 24/7 machine availability

### Option 3: Optimize for Free Tier
- **Reduce data size:** Already implemented (50 points)
- **Add retries:** Already implemented
- **Use fallback:** Already working
- **Accept limitations:** HTTP 502 is normal on free tier

## Current Status

✅ **EA is working correctly** with fallback system
✅ **Trading continues** even when backend fails
✅ **Error handling** gracefully manages server issues
✅ **Retry mechanism** attempts to reconnect

## Recommendation

For **development and testing**: Current setup is fine
For **live trading**: Consider upgrading to paid tier or local server

The EA will work reliably with the current fallback system, but you may see occasional HTTP 502 errors which is normal for the free tier.
